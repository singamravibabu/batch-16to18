# Exception Handling
- Syntactical errorrs
    Grammatical errorrs
- Usage errors: End user causes these errors

Whenever there is an exception the application fails.

## try construct syntax
try:
    statement(s) # code you want to run/execute
except:
    statement(s)


Exception Hierarchy:

Exception           # Parent of all exceptions (default)
    OSError         # OS related errors
        FileExistsError
        FileNotFoundError
    ValueError

Note: While handling errors, handle from specific to general.    


# syntax
try:
    statement(s) # code you want to run/execute
except:
    statement(s)
[except:
    statement(s)]...




# syntax
try:
    statement(s) # code you want to run/execute
except [ExceptionType] [as e]:
    statement(s)
[except [ExceptionType] [as e]:
    statement(s)]...
[finally:
    statement(s)]

- The code inside the finally clause always executes.


Always use exit() function from sys module when you want to end the program.

Raising an error using 'raise' statement:
raise ErrorName("Message")

raise ValueError('Invalid value)




# WORKING WITH FILES
####################
File is an object.
Two types of files:
    - Text
    Sequence of characters and lines
    At the end of each line there is a new line (\n) character
    .txt, html, csv, json, xml

    - Binary
    Sequence of bytes
    .exe, .msi, compressed, image, video, audio, etc.


# Working with text files
#######################
File operations:
1. open
2. read from the file or write to the file
3. close

# open a file
open(filename, mode)

- filename (may include the path)
- mode: read, write, append, binary, etc

The open() function returns a file_object,
 which assigned to a variable to work with the file.

mode
--------
1. r (read) default
    - This mode returns an exception when the file doesn't exist.
2. w (write)
    - This mode creates a file if it doesn't exist.
    - Caution: This mode truncates a file (erases data from an existing file)
3. a (append)
    - This mode creates a file if it doesn't exist.
    - If the file already exists then it will append the data to the file.
4. b (binary)
    - 'rb' for reading binary files
    - 'wb' for writing to binary files


### The 'with' statement in Python
Using 'with' statement in Python we can close a file automatically
 without explicitly using the close() method.

### Referencing a file:
1. Absolute reference
    D:\\Office\\Projects\\2025\\Zeneta\\docs\\file.txt
2. Relative reference
    file.txt        # file in the same folder
    ./file.txt     # file in the same folder
    ../file.txt     # file in the parent folder


### Reading data from a file using three methods
1. read()
    - Reads the entire file as one single string.
2. readline()
    - Reads one line at a time
3. readlines()
    - Reads the contents of a file into a list
    - Where each item in the list is a line of the file
